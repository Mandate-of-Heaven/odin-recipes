        <p>Gnocchi (singular gnocco) are Italian dumplings made with flour, eggs, and potatoes. Gnocchi can be served in tomato sauce, tossed with pesto, or saut√©ed with butter and herbs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Potatos</li>
            <p>Use starchy potatoes, such as russets.</p>

            <li>Flour</li>
            <p>All-purpose flour absorbs moisture and helps create gluten.</p>

            <li>Egg</li>
            <p>An egg lends moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the dumplings together.</p>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil and mash the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Combine the ingredients, then knead into a ball.</li>
            <li>Shape the dough into "snakes."</li>
            <li>Cut the snakes into pieces.</li>
            <li>Boil and drain the gnocchi.</li>
        </ol>
